# Chat-Application
Our Project is an example of chat application which is basically based on public chatting.

It is made of two applications. One client side application and other is server side application.

Client Application runs on userâ€™s device.

Server Application runs on any device on the network.

Once connection is established with server, clients can chat with each other.

There is chat app running code in my repostory and two word documents having code of server and client sides.
